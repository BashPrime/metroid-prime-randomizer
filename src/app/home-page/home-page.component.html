      Metroid Prime Randomizer is an item randomizer for Metroid Prime (for the Nintendo GameCube).
      Once all of the core features are implemented, you will be able to randomize and patch a
      Metroid Prime .iso from the comfort of your web browser.

  <h2>What is a randomizer? How does it work?</h2>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      The idea is that all 100 item locations in the game - upgrades, Chozo Artifacts, and expansions -
      are shuffled around. You never know what you're going to find, and that's what makes a randomizer
      so much fun to play! Depending on what items you get, your exploration through Tallon IV can be
      (drastically) different from game to game.
