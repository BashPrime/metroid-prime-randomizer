  <h2>Game Logics</h2>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      There are logic rules in place which prevent you from being locked out of progression and guaranteeing that youâ€™ll be able
      to finish the game every time regardless of the distribution of items. The different game modes use different logic
      and assume different levels of game knowledge and ability.
    </p>
    <mat-card>
      <h3>Casual</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode requires no advanced knowledge about the game, nor does it require any glitches to be used, making it ideal
          for casual players.</p>
        <p>
          This logic is designed to prevent players from getting stuck in as many locations as possible, but it is still possible to
          softlock when you enter a room that you're unable to leave (ex: vanilla beam rooms without the necessary beam to
          escape, Elite Quarters without obtaining X-Ray visor).

    <mat-card>
      <h3>Normal</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode accounts for some of the easier-to-execute glitches, techniques, and sequence breaks in the game. They
          are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dashing (such as scan dashing)</li>
          <li>Ghetto (Slope) Jumping</li>
          <li>L Jumping</li>
          <li>Visor skips for puzzles (such as power conduits, invisible platforms)</li>
          <li>Exploiting collision you can stand on (allows access to rooms and items without Spider Ball, Grapple Beam, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will never be forced to do any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NSJ (no space jump) techniques in rooms that expect you to have Space Jump Boots equipped (Pirate labs, Phazon
            Mines, etc.)</li>
          <li>Underwater ghetto jumps without Space Jump Boots</li>
          <li>Infinite Speed glitch</li>
          <li>Traversing Magmoor Caverns without a suit</li>
          <li>Traversing Twin Fires Tunnel by scan dashing or R jumping</li>
          <li>Out of bounds sequences, or tricks requiring you to go out of bounds</li>
          <li>Bars skip in Great Tree Hall</li>
          <li>Life Grove/Life Grove Tunnel without Boost Ball</li>
          <li>Geothermal Core puzzle without Boost Ball</li>
          <li>Exit Gravity Chamber without Gravity Suit</li>
          <li>Exit Quarantine Cave without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>Quarantine Monitor without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>Crashed Frigate without Gravity Suit or Wave Beam</li>
          <li>Phazon Mines past Ventilation Shaft without Boost Ball</li>
          <li>Spider Ball skips in Phazon Mines, such as spiderless shafts</li>
          <li>Root Cave, Magma Pool, Training Chamber Access, and Training Chamber without Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>"Early Wild" Infinite Bomb Jump</li>
        </ul>
      </mat-card-content>
    </mat-card>
    <mat-card>
      <h3>Hard</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode is a considerable step up from normal difficulty, meant to be similar to the Veteran difficulty that Interslice's
          seed generator uses.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All 22% tricks, and some of the easier 21% tricks, are required.</li>
          <li>You do NOT need to be suitless to collect all of the items in the first half of Magmoor Caverns.</li>
          <li>However, you MAY need to do a suitless Magmoor run to find progression items in Phendrana or Mines. The logic assumes
            a minimum of 5 required Energy Tanks for a standard VMR, and 1 or 2 tanks if going through Twin Fires Tunnel with Space Jump/Spider
            Ball.</li>
          <li>Boost Ball, Spider Ball, Space Jump Boots, and Grapple Beam can be found almost anywhere.</li>
          <li>All "lategame" areas (far Magmoor, far Phendrana, far Tallon, lower Phazon Mines) require either the Space Jump
            Boots or the Spider Ball for progression.</li>
          <li>Space Jump Boots will never be in Phazon Processing Center Access.</li>
          <li>Storage Cave and Security Cave require the Grapple Beam if you do not have Space Jump Boots.</li>
          <li>Floaty Jump is currently not required.</li>
          <li>Gravity Suit will never be in the crashed frigate.</li>
          <li>The following out-of-bounds wallcrawls are accounted for:
            <ul>
              <li>Ice Beam Before Flaahgra</li>
              <li>Crossway Infinite Speed</li>
              <li>Wave/Sun IS</li>
              <li>Training Chamber</li>
              <li>Arbor Chamber</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
