    <h2>Game Logics</h2>
    <md-card-content>
      <p>
        There are logic rules in place which prevent you from being locked out of progression and guaranteeing
        that youâ€™ll be able to finish the game every time regardless of the distribution of items. The different
        game modes use different logic and assume different levels of game knowledge and ability.

        <h3>No Glitches</h3>
        <md-card-content>
          <p>This mode requires no advanced knowledge about the game, and is ideal for casual players.</p>
          <p>
            This logic is designed to prevent players from getting stuck in as many locations as possible,
            but it is still possible to softlock when you enter a room that you're unable to leave (ex: vanilla
            beam rooms without the necessary beam to escape, Elite Quarters without obtaining X-Ray visor).

          <h3>Naive</h3>
          <md-card-content>
            <p>This mode simply places items in random locations without any logic checking.</p>
            <p>
              This mode shouldn't be taken seriously, and is recommended for testing purposes only
              due to the sheer number of incompleteable seeds it can produce.
