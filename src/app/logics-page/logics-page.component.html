    <h2>Game Logics</h2>
    <mat-card-content>
      <p>
        There are logic rules in place which prevent you from being locked out of progression and guaranteeing
        that youâ€™ll be able to finish the game every time regardless of the distribution of items. The different
        game modes use different logic and assume different levels of game knowledge and ability.
      </p>

        <h3>No Glitches</h3>
        <mat-card-content>
          <p>This mode requires no advanced knowledge about the game, and is ideal for casual players.</p>
          <p>
            This logic is designed to prevent players from getting stuck in as many locations as possible,
            but it is still possible to softlock when you enter a room that you're unable to leave (ex: vanilla
            beam rooms without the necessary beam to escape, Elite Quarters without obtaining X-Ray visor).

        <h3>Easy Glitches (to be added)</h3>
        <mat-card-content>
          <p>This mode accounts for some of the easier-to-execute glitches, techniques, and sequence breaks in the game. They are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Dashing (such as scan dashing)</li>
            <li>Slope Jumping</li>
            <li>L Jumping</li>
            <li>Visor skips for puzzles (such as power conduits, invisible platforms)</li>
            <li>Exploiting collision you can stand on (allows access to rooms and items without Spider Ball, Grapple Beam, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You will never be forced to do any of the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NSJ (no space jump) techniques in rooms that expect you to have Space Jump Boots equipped (Pirate labs, Phazon Mines, etc.)</li>
            <li>Underwater slope jumps without Space Jump Boots</li>
            <li>Infinite Speed glitch</li>
            <li>Traversing Magmoor Caverns without a suit</li>
            <li>Traversing Twin Fires Tunnel by scan dashing or R jumping</li>
            <li>Out of bounds sequences</li>
            <li>Tricks requiring you to go out of bounds (such as floaty jump)</li>
            <li>Bars skip in Great Tree Hall</li>
            <li>Life Grove/Life Grove Tunnel without Boost Ball</li>
            <li>Geothermal Core puzzle without Boost Ball</li>
            <li>Exit Gravity Chamber without Gravity Suit</li>
            <li>Exit Quarantine Cave without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
            <li>Quarantine Monitor without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
            <li>Crashed Frigate without Gravity Suit or Wave Beam</li>
            <li>Phazon Mines without Spider Ball</li>
            <li>Spider Ball skips in Phazon Mines, such as spiderless shafts</li>
            <li>Magma Pool, Training Chamber Access, and Training Chamber without Grapple Beam</li>
            <li>"Early Wild" Infinite Bomb Jump</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Moderate Glitches</h3>
          <mat-card-content>
            <p>To be written...</p>

        </mat-card>
      <mat-card>
          <h3>Naive</h3>
          <mat-card-content>
            <p>This mode simply places items in random locations without any logic checking.</p>
            <p>
              This mode shouldn't be taken seriously, and is recommended for testing purposes only
              due to the sheer number of incompleteable seeds it can produce.
