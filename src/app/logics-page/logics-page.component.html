  <h2>Game Logics</h2>
  <mat-card-content>
    <p>
      There are logic rules in place which prevent you from being locked out of progression and guaranteeing that youâ€™ll be able
      to finish the game every time regardless of the distribution of items. The different game modes use different logic
      and assume different levels of game knowledge and ability.
    </p>
    <mat-card>
      <h3>No Glitches</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode requires no advanced knowledge about the game, and is ideal for casual players.</p>
        <p>
          This logic is designed to prevent players from getting stuck in as many locations as possible, but it is still possible to
          softlock when you enter a room that you're unable to leave (ex: vanilla beam rooms without the necessary beam to
          escape, Elite Quarters without obtaining X-Ray visor).

      <h3>Easy Glitches (to be added)</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode accounts for some of the easier-to-execute glitches, techniques, and sequence breaks in the game. They
          are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dashing (such as scan dashing)</li>
          <li>Slope Jumping</li>
          <li>L Jumping</li>
          <li>Visor skips for puzzles (such as power conduits, invisible platforms)</li>
          <li>Exploiting collision you can stand on (allows access to rooms and items without Spider Ball, Grapple Beam, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will never be forced to do any of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>NSJ (no space jump) techniques in rooms that expect you to have Space Jump Boots equipped (Pirate labs, Phazon
            Mines, etc.)</li>
          <li>Underwater slope jumps without Space Jump Boots</li>
          <li>Infinite Speed glitch</li>
          <li>Traversing Magmoor Caverns without a suit</li>
          <li>Traversing Twin Fires Tunnel by scan dashing or R jumping</li>
          <li>Out of bounds sequences, or tricks requiring you to go out of bounds</li>
          <li>Bars skip in Great Tree Hall</li>
          <li>Life Grove/Life Grove Tunnel without Boost Ball</li>
          <li>Geothermal Core puzzle without Boost Ball</li>
          <li>Exit Gravity Chamber without Gravity Suit</li>
          <li>Exit Quarantine Cave without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>Quarantine Monitor without Spider Ball or Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>Crashed Frigate without Gravity Suit or Wave Beam</li>
          <li>Phazon Mines without Spider Ball</li>
          <li>Spider Ball skips in Phazon Mines, such as spiderless shafts</li>
          <li>Root Cave, Magma Pool, Training Chamber Access, and Training Chamber without Grapple Beam</li>
          <li>"Early Wild" Infinite Bomb Jump</li>
        </ul>

    </mat-card>
    <mat-card>
      <h3>Moderate Glitches</h3>
      <mat-card-content>
        <p>This mode accounts for more significant sequence breaks and more difficult tricks than Easy Glitches:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All dashes with Space Jump equipped</li>
          <li>R Jumping</li>
          <li>Using some of the easier NSJ (No Space Jump) movement in a few rooms</li>
          <li>Underwater slope jumps without Space Jump equipped</li>
          <li>"Early Wild" Infinite Bomb Jump (IBJ) in Sun Tower</li>
          <li>The following uses of the Infinite Speed glitch:
            <ul>
              <li>"Early Sun" IS (in Chapel of the Elders)</li>
              <li>Magma Pool IS</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Bars skip in Great Tree Hall</li>
          <li>Climbing Frigate Crash Site (with Space Jump)</li>
          <li>Grapple Beam is no longer required if you have Space Jump equipped</li>
          <li>Skipping Boost Ball, Spider Ball, and Gravity Suit almost everywhere (see below for constraints)</li>
          <li>Boost Ball is only required for Life Grove, Life Grove Tunnel, and Plasma Processing</li>
          <li>Traversing most of Magmoor Caverns without a suit upgrade. The logic required a minimum of 5 Energy Tanks</li>
          <li>If "Allow Out-of-Bounds" is checked, the following wallcrawls:
            <ul>Wave/Sun IS</ul>
            <ul>Arbor Chamber</ul>
            <ul>Training Chamber/Training Chamber Access</ul>
            <ul>Chozo Ruins floaty jump for Dynamo and Training Chamber IBJ</ul>
            <ul>Magmoor Caverns floaty jump for Geothermal Core IBJ</ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You will never be forced to do any of the following:
