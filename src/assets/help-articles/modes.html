<h2>Game Modes</h2>
<p>Game modes currently affect how items are randomized.</p>
<h3>Standard</h3>
<p>
    This mode randomizes upgrades, artifacts, and expansions across all 100 item locations. Upgrades and artifacts can be found
    where expansions were normally located, and vice-versa.
</p>
<h3>Major Items</h3>
<p>
    Items are shuffled in two separate pools: Upgrades/Artifacts/Energy Tanks in one, and Missile/Power Bomb Expansions in the
    other.
</p>
<p>
    All major items (upgrades, artifacts, Energy Tanks) will be located in the game's original major item locations, and will
    never be found where Missile or Power Bomb expansions were originally located. Ammo expansions will never be placed in
    major item locations.
</p>
<p>
    This mode is very similar to how

    shuffles upgrades and ammo packs.
