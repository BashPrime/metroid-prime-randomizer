<h2>Patching Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Acquire a Metroid Prime ISO file.
        <b>Make sure it is the NTSC 0-00 version.</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/aprilwade/randomprime/releases/latest" target="_blank">Download the latest version of the randomprime patcher</a> if you have not already done so.</li>
    <li>Run the randomprime patcher. It will ask you for the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Input file name</i>. This is the relative file path of your Metroid Prime ISO file. You only need to type
                this once. Press Enter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Layout descriptor</i>. This is your randomized item layout. Copy the Layout Descriptor text on this page,
                then paste it into the program. Press Enter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Skip the Frigate Level</i>. It should already be defaulted to "Yes", so just press Enter.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Output file name</i>. This can be whatever file name you want, but don't forget to include ".iso" at the
                end as the patcher will not do it for you. You only need to type this once. Press Enter.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Your randomized Metroid Prime ISO file will be created, and you can run it using whichever Wii or GameCube loader you
        prefer, or with an emulator.</li>
    <li>After running the randomprime patcher for the first time, it will save your file name and frigate settings. Now, you
        can run the patcher and simply press Enter for everything except the layout descriptor, which you will need to copy
        and paste from this website.</li>
</ol>
