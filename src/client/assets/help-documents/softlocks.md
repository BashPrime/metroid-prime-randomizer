# Softlocks

Softlocks are situations where the game is usually still playable, but further progression is impossible.

If you're not careful, you can accidentally find yourself in a room without the item needed to leave it, causing you to softlock. While the randomizer handles a lot of these cases, there are some that it does not and cannot account for.

## Ruined Shrine

If you fall into the pit in Ruined Shrine, you will need either the Morph Ball or Space Jump Boots to escape. If you get stuck, you can slope jump and abuse the standable terrain on the large vine near where the Beetle Battle item is, then dash across to the half pipe, but this is never expected of players.

## Burn Dome

If you do not have bombs, the Morph Ball tunnel leading to Burn Dome is a one-way trip. You will be stuck and softlocked if you do not find bombs there.

## Chapel of the Elders, Antechamber, and Plasma Processing

These rooms use different door colors to enter and leave them, so you can get stuck if you enter the room without having the necessary beam to open the door from the inside.

## Warrior Shrine Tunnel

If you enter the tunnel underneath Warrior Shrine without having bombs, you will get stuck.

## Shore Tunnel

If you do not have Space Jump Boots, you will either need to double bomb jump or perform a precise slope jump to reach the broken tube from the pit underneath.

## Phendrana Canyon

If you do not have Boost Ball or Space Jump Boots after entering the room, you will need to jump on the crates to leave. If the crates are destroyed, you will get stuck.

## Observatory

The bottom door only locks when you get near it. If you enter Observatory from the top door and kill the Space Pirates before triggering the lock, it will stay locked while you are still in the room. If you cannot complete the puzzle to extend the platforms, or know how to climb the room with dashes, you will softlock.

Make sure you trigger the door lock first, then kill the Space Pirates.

## Control Tower

If you collapse the tower and enter the section where the item is without bombs, you will be unable to escape in a glitchless setting.

## Quarantine Cave

You can get stuck in Quarantine Cave if you do not have Spider Ball, Grapple Beam, or know how to slope jump to escape the room.

## Lower Phazon Mines / Ventilation Shaft

If you fall down into the half pipe section of Ventilation Shaft, you will either need Boost Ball to leave the way you entered, or the minimum items needed to traverse through lower Phazon Mines, defeat Omega Pirate, and reach Phazon Processing Center through Processing Center Access. If you cannot do either of these, you will be stuck.

## Elite Quarters

If you start the Omega Pirate fight and don't have X-Ray Visor, you will softlock. Omega Pirate can only take damage while you have X-Ray Visor equipped, and the room will only unlock after defeating it.

## Metroid Prime Lair

You can only use the Phazon Beam if you have the Phazon Suit, and Metroid Prime Essence can only take damage from the Phazon Beam. If you start the fight without the Phazon Suit, you will be unable to continue.
