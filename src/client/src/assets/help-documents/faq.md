# FAQ

This article addresses the most common questions and issues that new players experience with the randomizer. If you're still having problems after reading this and want help from other people, [please join our Discord server](http://discord.gg/WWGcay6)!

## I get a black screen whenever I load a game from the main menu.

The most common reason this happens is because you're loading an existing save slot in a seed that has **Skip the Space Pirate Frigate** checked. You can confirm this for yourself by opening the main menu and checking if the middle section of your save slot shows `??????` instead of a region, such as `Space Pirate Frigate` or `Tallon Overworld`.

Every time you play a randomizer seed, you should always start from a brand-new save slot to ensure that you don't start a game with missing items, broken artifacts, etc. If you have an existing save, make sure you delete it before starting a seed.

## My seed is broken. Items are missing, artifacts aren't working, I'm starting out with items, etc.

The randomizer doesn't work (or work *well*) with pre-existing saves. You need to start from a brand-new save slot each time you play a randomizer seed or else you might run into this issue.

## The game crashes if I lay a Morph Ball Bomb while submerged in water or lava.

We don't have a definitive answer for this, but we think it has to do with running the randomizer with an unclean Metroid Prime .iso file.

You can use the [GameTDB page](https://www.gametdb.com/Wii/GM8E01) to see if your .iso file has a matching MD5 or SHA-1 checksum. If it matches, you have a clean file! If it doesn't, it's very possible your file is corrupted.

## The game crashes if I try to load a room, or open a door.

Either your base Metroid Prime .iso file is corrupted, or your hard drive/external storage is running into hardware problems. Try playing on another hard drive, SD card, or flash drive to see if the problem persists.

## I'm trying to enter a room, but the door never opens after I shoot it.

This is a variation of the above problem, except the game doesn't crash. Try running the same seed on a different storage device and see if the problem persists.

## I obtained a beam combo (Super Missile, Wavebuster, Ice Spreader, Flamethrower), but I can't use it.

You need the Charge Beam equipped in order to use beam combos.

## The big red flower isn't there when I enter Sunchamber (Flaahgra's room).

This happens when you enter Sunchamber from the Sun Tower side without fighting Flaahgra first. If you have Space Jump Boots, you can slope jump from one of the roots to reach the item that spawns after the Chozo Ghost fight, otherwise you won't be able to load the Flaahgra fight. If you don't have Space Jump Boots, or Flaahgra blocks access to them, you are softlocked and need to restart.

## I can't hurt Omega Pirate.

Omega Pirate can only be hurt while you have the X-Ray Visor active. If you start the boss fight and don't have the X-Ray Visor, you will softlock.

## The upper door next to the Metroid in Research Lab Aether is locked and won't unlock.

The upper door locks if the Metroid breaks out of its container. It will not unlock until you reload the room, which you can do by going back to Research Core Access, loading Research Core, then returning to Research Lab Aether.

## The bottom door in Observatory is locked and won't unlock.

You killed the two Space Pirates that normally jump down from the ledge near the save station before triggering the door lock. If you don't have Boost Ball, or don't know how to scan dash to climb back up the room, you are softlocked, but you can otherwise leave the top door of the room and reload Observatory to get rid of the door lock.

Make sure you trigger the door lock first before killing the space pirates.

## Why is Varia Suit in Phendrana Drifts? I don't have heat protection to get there!

The second half of Magmoor Caverns (past Twin Fires Tunnel) is not superheated, so the logic is likely expecting you to go to the Phendrana Quarantine Cave elevator by going to Magmoor Workstation from Phazon Mines.
