# FAQ

This article addresses the most common questions and issues that new players experience with the randomizer. If you're still having problems after reading this and want help from other people, [please join our Discord server](http://discord.gg/WWGcay6)!

## I get a black screen whenever I load a game from the main menu.

The most common reason this happens is because you're loading an existing save slot in a seed that has **Skip the Space Pirate Frigate** checked. You can confirm this for yourself by opening the main menu and checking if the middle section of your save slot shows `??????` instead of a region, such as `Space Pirate Frigate` or `Tallon Overworld`.

Every time you play a randomizer seed, you should always start from a brand-new save slot to ensure that you don't start a game with missing items, broken artifacts, etc. If you have an existing save, make sure you delete it before starting a seed.

## My seed is broken. Items are missing, artifacts aren't working, I'm starting out with items, etc.

The randomizer doesn't work (or work *well*) with pre-existing save slots. You need to start from a brand-new save slot each time you play a randomizer seed or else you might run into this issue.

## The game crashes if I lay a Morph Ball Bomb while submerged in water or lava.

We don't have a definitive answer for this, but we think it has to do with running the randomizer with an unclean Metroid Prime .iso file.

You can verify if your base .iso file is clean by clicking the **Verify** button next to the Base ISO textbox in the Game Details page.

## The game crashes if I try to load a room, or open a door.

Either your base Metroid Prime .iso file is corrupted, or your hard drive/external storage is running into hardware problems. Try playing on another hard drive, SD card, or flash drive to see if the problem persists.

## I'm trying to enter a room, but the door never opens after I shoot it.

This is a variation of the above problem, except the game doesn't crash. Try running the same seed on a different storage device and see if the problem persists.

## I obtained a beam combo (Super Missile, Wavebuster, Ice Spreader, Flamethrower), but I can't use it.

You need to obtain the Charge Beam in order to use beam combos.

## I can't hurt Omega Pirate.

Omega Pirate can only be hurt while you have the X-Ray Visor active. If you start the boss fight and don't have the X-Ray Visor, you will softlock.

## The upper door next to the Metroid in Research Lab Aether is locked and won't unlock.

The upper door locks if the Metroid breaks out of its container. It will not unlock until you reload the room, which you can do by going back to Research Core Access, loading Research Core, then returning to Research Lab Aether.

## The bottom door in Observatory is locked and won't unlock.

You killed the two Space Pirates that normally jump down from the ledge near the save station before triggering the door lock. If you don't have Boost Ball, or don't know how to scan dash to climb back up the room, you are softlocked, but you can otherwise leave the top door of the room and reload Observatory to get rid of the door lock.

Make sure you trigger the door lock first before killing the space pirates.

## Why is Varia Suit in Phendrana Drifts? I don't have heat protection to get there.

The second half of Magmoor Caverns (past Twin Fires Tunnel) is not superheated, so the logic is likely expecting you to go to the Phendrana Quarantine Cave elevator by going to Magmoor Workstation from Phazon Mines.

## When Samus morphs, her Morph Ball form looks different than her suit.

Metroid Prime does not contain any 3D models or assets for Power Suit Spider Ball, Gravity Suit spiderless Morph Ball, and Phazon Suit spiderless Morph Ball, so it does the following:

If Samus has the Power Suit and the Spider Ball, the game uses the Gravity Suit Spider Ball model when she is morphed.

If Samus has the Gravity Suit or Phazon Suit but does not have Spider Ball, the game uses the Power Suit Morph Ball model when she is morphed.

## I found a blue missile. What the heck? Is my game bugged?

Your game is fine; You found a Shiny Missile!

Shiny Missiles are exactly the same as regular Missiles, but are blue instead of red-orange. Missiles have a 1 in 1024 chance of being shiny.
