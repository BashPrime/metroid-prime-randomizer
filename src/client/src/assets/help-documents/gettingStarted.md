# Getting Started

3. Click **Generate**. If you want the option to save a spoiler log, click **Generate with Spoilers**. When the seed is done generating, you will be taken to the Game Details page.

    * The randomizer will usually generate a seed without any issues, but with some settings it may fail to do so. If this happens, click one of the Generate buttons again. Unless you change the item overrides in a way that makes the game unable to be completed, the randomizer will generate a seed sooner or later.

4. Select a Metroid Prime ISO file for your base ISO that the patcher will use.
    
    * You can only use a NTSC-USA Nintendo GameCube version of Metroid Prime.
    
    * You can click the **Verify** button to confirm what version of Metroid Prime you are using. If the Game Code and MD5 Hash fields have checkmarks, you're good to go!

5. (Optional) You can choose where to save your randomized seeds and spoiler logs. If left to default, they will be saved in your `Documents/Metroid Prime` folder.

6. (Optional) If you have a ISO of Metroid Prime Trilogy, the randomizer can use it to fix the Flaahgra boss music.

7. (Optional) You can change the output type and save your generated seed to a compressed ISO, or a compressed Gamecube Archive file.

8. Click **Save Spoiler** to save your spoiler log (or logs) to the output folder.

9. Click **Save ISO** to patch your randomized seeds and save them to the output folder.

    * Files are automatically saved using the name `Prime - <Seed Hash>` to the output folder.
