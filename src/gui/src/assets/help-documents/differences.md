# Differences

This randomizer uses Syncathetic's randomprime patcher, which makes some changes to Metroid Prime for quality of life reasons. Here are the changes that are always applied:

* Missile and power bomb capacities are shown in the HUD.
* The Phazon Elite in Elite Research can now be broken out of its container as soon as you can visit the room.
* The scan point that disables the forcefield in Research Lab Hydra can now be scanned from either side of the forcefield.
* The FMV that plays when you start a game from the main menu is no longer random. The patcher chooses one of the three FMVs to use depending on the seed, but it will be the same one for every player that uses the same seed.
* The Hint System is turned off by default.
* The cutscene in Temple Security Station has been removed.
* The Ridley flyover cutscene in Phendrana Shorelines has been removed.
* You can safely enter Sunchamber and fight Flaahgra from the Sun Tower side. To trigger the Sunchamber Chozo Ghost layer change, you will need to return to Sun Tower and touch the trigger near the top of the spider track after defeating Flaahgra.
* Research Lab Aether's glass will be broken if you collect the Research Core item before visiting the room for the first time, allowing you access to Control Tower and the rest of the pirate labs.
* Observatory's Boost Ball puzzle can now be done at any time, regardless if you collect the Research Core item beforehand (or not).
* The door in Main Ventilation Shaft Section B is now powered on by default, allowing you to traverse through the entire crashed frigate in reverse on your first visit.
* Virtually every obstacle added in NTSC 1.02 and PAL has been removed, or reverted back to their 1.00 behavior.
* You will no longer be softlocked in Mine Security Station if you kill the pirate troopers before triggering the Security Access A door lock.
* The Grapple point in Gravity Chamber will no longer disappear if you leave the room and return later.
